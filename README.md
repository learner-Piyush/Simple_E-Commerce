# Simple_E-Commerce
This is my fully functional Simple E-Commerce website. It consists of HTML file which is essential for structure, CSS file for design and JS file for functionality.

In this project, some products are registered with unique id, name and price.
If you click the "Add to Cart" button of an indivisual product, it will be pushed into cart.
If you want to duplicate the product in your cart then you can duplicate it.
Once you are done click the "Checkout" button and get a pop up message.

Logic is simple if you open and look at the JS file.

And yeah I have added icons for buttons.

Let me know if you like the design and experience as well
